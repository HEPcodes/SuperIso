Supersymmetric Isospin asymmetry (SuperIso) v1.0
-------------------------------------------------
By Farvah Nazila Mahmoudi (nazila.mahmoudi@tsl.uu.se)


INTRODUCTION
------------

The most recent version of this program can be obtained from: 
http://www3.tsl.uu.se/~nazila/superiso/

This C code (in C99 standard) provides a calculation of isospin asymmetry and inclusive branching ratio corresponding to b-> s gamma for a set of supersymmetric parameters, which can be either calculated within this program thanks to Isajet or Softsusy, or directly given thanks to a SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA) file.

If you use this program to write a paper, please cite F. Mahmoudi, arXiv:0710.2067.

The program have been tested on Linux and Mac machines with gcc and icc.


Installation and Compilation
----------------------------
- tar xzvf superiso_vX.X.tgz
- cd superiso_vX.X
- in Makefile, first define your C compiler, and the path to Isajet or Softsusy, if you want to use them. If not, you should provide your SLHA file as input.
- compile with: make

5 programs are available:
- msugra.c: msugra parameter space, linked to isajet or softsusy
- amsb.c: amsb parameter space, linked to softsusy
- gmsb.c: gmsb parameter space, linked to softsusy
- main_example.c: test-program
- slha.c: scans the SLHA file

They can be compiled with: make name, where "name" stands for msugra, amsb, gmsb, main_example, or slha.

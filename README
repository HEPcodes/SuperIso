INTRODUCTION
------------
The most recent version of this program can be obtained from: 
http://superiso.in2p3.fr

This C code (in C99 standard) provides the calculation of several flavor physics observables as well as the muon anomalous magnetic moment, for a set of supersymmetric or 2HDM parameters which can be either calculated within this program thanks to Isajet, Softsusy or 2HDMC, or directly provided by user thanks to a SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA1 or SLHA2) file.


If you use this program to write a paper, please cite:

AND

The program has been tested on Linux and Mac machines with gcc and icc.


Installation and Compilation
----------------------------
- tar xzvf superiso_vX.X.tgz
- cd superiso_vX.X
- in Makefile, first define your C compiler, and the path to Isajet, Softsusy or 2HDMC, if you want to use them. If not, you must provide your SLHA file as input.
- compile with: make

7 programs are available:
- sm.c: Standard Model
- msugra.c: msugra parameter space, linked to isajet or softsusy
- amsb.c: amsb parameter space, linked to isajet (>=7.80) or softsusy
- gmsb.c: gmsb parameter space, linked to isajet (>=7.80) or softsusy
- nuhm.c: nuhm parameter space, linked to isajet (>=7.80) or softsusy
- thdm.c: 2HDM types I-IV parameter space, linked to 2HDMC
- slha.c: scans the user provided SLHA file

They can be compiled with: make name (or make name.c), where "name" stands for sm, msugra, amsb, gmsb, nuhm, thdm or slha.

They can be run with: ./name.x
Note that an example of SLHA file is also provided: example.lha

INTRODUCTION
------------
The most recent version of this program can be obtained from: 
http://superiso.in2p3.fr

This C code (in C99 standard) provides the calculation of several flavour physics observables as well as the muon anomalous magnetic moment, for a set of supersymmetric or 2HDM parameters which can be either calculated within this program using the provided interfaces with Isajet, Softsusy, SuSpect, SPheno, NMSSMTools or 2HDMC, or directly supplied by user thanks to a SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA1 or SLHA2) file.

The program has been tested on Linux and Mac machines with gcc and icc.


Installation and Compilation
----------------------------
- tar xzvf superiso_vX.X.tgz
- cd superiso_vX.X
- in Makefile, first define your C compiler, and the path to Isajet, Softsusy, SPheno, SuSpect, NMSSMTools, HiggsBounds (HBwithFH, see below) or 2HDMC, if you want to use them. If not, you must comment them in the main programs.
- compile with: make

12 programs are available:
- sm.c: Standard Model
- cmssm.c: cmssm parameter space, linked to isajet, softsusy, spheno or suspect
- amsb.c: amsb parameter space, linked to isajet (>=7.80), softsusy, spheno or suspect
- hcamsb.c: hypercharged amsb parameter space, linked to isajet (>=7.80)
- mmamsb.c: mixed moduli amsb parameter space, linked to isajet (>=7.80)
- gmsb.c: gmsb parameter space, linked to isajet (>=7.80), softsusy, spheno or suspect
- nuhm.c: nuhm parameter space, linked to isajet (>=7.80), softsusy or suspect
- thdm.c: 2HDM types I-IV parameter space, linked to 2HDMC
- slha.c: scans the user provided SLHA file
- cnmssm.c: semi constrained NMSSM parameter space, linked to NMSSMTools
- ngmsb.c: NMSSM GMSB parameter space, linked to NMSSMTools
- nnuhm.c: NMSSM NUHM parameter space, linked to NMSSMTools

They can be compiled with: make name (or make name.c), where "name" stands for sm, cmssm, amsb, gmsb, nuhm, ...

They can be run with: ./name.x
Note that an example of SLHA file is also provided: example.lha

To use Higgsbounds limits when using SuperIso, the user has to have compiled HBwithFH (provided in the Higgsbound package) as well as FeynHiggs. More details are given in the following:
- In HiggsBounds-f90/configure choose the same compiler as the one with which FeynHiggs is compiled. Also, provide the link to FHINCLUDE and FHLIBS. For example 
FHINCLUDE = -I/path/FeynHiggs-2.8.6/build/include
FHLIBS = -L/path/FeynHiggs-2.8.6/build/ -lFH
- In HiggsBounds-f90/example_programs/HBwithFH.F comment "call setPara" and uncomment "call setSLHA("tmp.slha")" instead.
- In HiggsBounds-f90/example_programs, run: ./demonstrateHiggsBounds_HBwithFH.bat to compile HBwithFH.
- In the SuperIso Makefile, add the path to HBwithFH.
